	 *
	 * @param heldStack     The item stack that was used to determine the default result.
	 *                      May be empty. If no light was found, will be from the secondary hand.
	 *
	 * @param defaultResult The light result determined by the renderer. Will be the same in all
	 *                      listener invocations. Use this to know if another listener has
	 *                      already changed the current result.
	 *
	 * @param currentResult The light result that should be returned if the listener does not
	 *                      modify it. May already have been changed by a prior listener.
	 *                      Compare with default result to detect this.
	 *
	 * @return              The light that should be used. Return {@link ItemLight#NONE} to disable
	 *                      held light. Can be modified by subsequent listener invocations.
