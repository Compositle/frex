 * Use to make FREX an optional dependency. To do so, implement this interface
 * in a stand-alone class and declare a "frex" end point in the mod's
 * fabric.mod.json that points to the implementation.  For example:
 *
 * <p><pre>
 * "entrypoints": {
 *    "frex": [ "yourorg.yourmod.yourpackage.XmFrexInitializer" ]
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Every mod that implements this interface and declares and end point will receive
 * exactly one call to {@link #onInitalizeFrex()}.
 *
 * <p>To maintain an optional dependency, all calls to FREX methods must be isolated to
 * the FrexInitializer instance or to classes that are only loaded if {@link #onInitalizeFrex()}
 * is called.
 *
 * <p>Note that it is NOT necessary to implement this interface and register a
 * "frex" end point for mods that nest the FREX library or have a hard dependency on FREX.
 * Such mods can safely handle FREX registration in their client initialize instance.
