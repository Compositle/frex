 * Called after entity, terrain, and particle translucent layers have been
 * drawn to the framebuffer but before translucency combine has happened
 * in fabulous mode.
 *
 * <p>Use for drawing overlays or other effects on top of those targets
 * (or the main target when fabulous isn't active) before clouds and weather
 * are drawn.  However, note that {@code WorldRenderPostEntityCallback} will
 * offer better results in most use cases.
 *
 * <p>Vertex consumers are not available in this event because all buffered quads
 * are drawn before this event is called.  Any rendering here must be drawn
 * directly to the frame buffer.  The render state matrix will not include
 * camera transformation, so {@link #LAST} may be preferable if that is wanted.
